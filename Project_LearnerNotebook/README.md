# PYF Project Learner Notebook

## Overview

The PYF Project Learner Notebook is designed to provide an interactive learning experience for understanding key Python concepts and libraries. This project demonstrates the use of Python for data analysis, visualization, and basic machine learning techniques, making it an excellent resource for learners and practitioners.

## Project Structure

- **Files:**
  - `PYF_Project_LearnerNotebook.html`: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing code, explanations, and outputs.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis:**
  - Utilize libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
  - Perform data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Create insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  - Demonstrate various plotting techniques to visualize data distributions and relationships.

- **Machine Learning:**
  - Implement basic machine learning models using Scikit-learn.
  - Evaluate model performance and understand the importance of model selection.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab are installed on your system.

2. **Setup:**
   - Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
